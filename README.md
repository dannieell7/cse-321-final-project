# cse-321-final-project
## Parts for the project
### For the building of this project you would need the following hardware:
1) Arduino Kit
2) Breadboard
3) Jumper wires
4) LCD
5) LEDs
6) Resistors
7) Potentiometer
8) Buttons
   
## Steps to set up this project
1) Buy an Arduino kit on Amazon
2) Buy a second breadboard because the whole project would not fit on a singular breadboard.
3) You would then start to build out the project's different components.
4) Build the LCD. You can find multiple resources to build this online.
5) Then connect the button that would start the timer. Again you can find resources to do this online.
6) If there is no space on your current breadboard, you would connect the components for the Simon game on a separate breadboard.
   - You can choose to use two LEDs for the sequences or three depending on how complicated you want your project.
7) You would then set up another LED to signify the winning or losing of the game.
8) That LED would blink repeatedly signifying that the box has been open.

## Explanation of what the project does
- So basically the project simulates a phone safe/box
- There is a button that starts the timer and the timer goes on for a specified number of times.
- Once time elapses, the user is prompted to start the Simon game.
- The sequences of the Simon begins.
- Once the user completes all the sequences, a green LED will blink signifying that the user beat the game and the box is open.

## Explanation of how to use and interact with the project
- Press the button to start the timer
- Wait for the timer to end
- Press the button again to start the Simon game
- Based on the sequences you see press the respective button
- Once you complete all the sequences the blinking LED would signify the end of the game as well as the open box.
- THAT IS ALL.
